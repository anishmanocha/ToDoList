# ToDoList
To Do List utilizing Mongo, Express, HTML, Semantic UI, CSS, and JS

Hi everyone, thank you for taking the time to look at my first personal project.  

If you're interested in seeing screenshots of the application, please go to the Issues tab.  

If you're interested in looking at the code, please start in the app.js file.  This lists all the Express routes, and from those, you can look at the ejs templates that are rendered at each route.
